### **Caesar Cipher Encryption Code Documentation**

#### **Overview:**
This script implements a simple Caesar cipher for text encryption. The user is prompted to input a message, and the program shifts each letter by a specified number of positions in the alphabet to produce an encoded (encrypted) message.

#### **How It Works:**
- The user specifies whether they want to "encode" or "decode" (although only "encode" functionality is currently implemented in the provided code).
- The user inputs a message that is converted to lowercase.
- The user specifies a shift number, which determines how many positions each letter will be shifted in the alphabet.
- The function `encrypt()` is used to process the message by shifting each letter by the specified amount.

#### **Key Components:**

- **`alphabet`:** A list of lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. This serves as a reference for shifting letters.
  
  ```python
  alphabet = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
  ```

- **`direction`:** A prompt asking the user whether they want to "encode" or "decode" the message (though decoding functionality is not included in this snippet). This input is converted to lowercase to ensure consistency.
  
  ```python
  direction = input("Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:\n").lower()
  ```

- **`text`:** The user's message, converted to lowercase to ensure that the cipher operates correctly on all input letters.
  
  ```python
  text = input("Type your message:\n").lower()
  ```

- **`shift`:** The number of positions to shift each letter in the alphabet, provided as an integer.
  
  ```python
  shift = int(input("Type the shift number:\n"))
  ```

- **`encrypt(original_text, shift_amount)`:** A function that takes the user's input message and shifts each letter by the specified amount to produce the encrypted text.
  
  #### Function Breakdown:
  - **Parameters:**
    - `original_text`: The input text that the user wants to encrypt.
    - `shift_amount`: The number of positions each letter is shifted in the alphabet.
  
  - **Logic:**
    - An empty string `cypher_text` is initialized to store the final encrypted message.
    - A `for` loop iterates over each character in the input message.
    - For each letter, the index in the alphabet is determined using `alphabet.index(i)`, and the shift amount is added to it.
    - Modulo operation (`% len(alphabet)`) ensures that the shift wraps around the alphabet if it goes beyond 'z'.
    - The shifted letter is then added to the `cypher_text`.
    - Finally, the encrypted message is printed.

  #### Example:
  ```python
  def encrypt(original_text, shift_amount):
      cypher_text = ""
      
      for i in original_text:
          shifted_position = alphabet.index(i) + shift_amount
          shifted_position %= len(alphabet)
          cypher_text += alphabet[shifted_position]
      print(f"Here is the encoded result: {cypher_text}")
  ```

#### **Example Usage:**

```bash
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
encode
Type your message:
hello
Type the shift number:
3
Here is the encoded result: khoor
```

- In this example, the message "hello" is shifted by 3 positions, resulting in "khoor".

#### **Limitations:**
- The code currently only supports lowercase letters and does not handle spaces, punctuation, or numbers.
- There is no decoding functionality implemented yet, despite the prompt suggesting it.

#### **Potential Improvements:**
- Add functionality to "decode" messages by reversing the shift.
- Handle non-alphabetical characters (like spaces, numbers, and punctuation) by ignoring them or treating them differently.
- Allow the program to handle uppercase letters.
